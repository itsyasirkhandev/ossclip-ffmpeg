# Working in this repo

## Model routing

The session's own model does the thinking in the main thread: exploring the
codebase, design, writing plans, reviewing what came back, and any debugging
where the cause is not yet known.

Delegated steps run the SAME model as the session — the `executor` subagent
(`.claude/agents/executor.md`) is `model: inherit`, and ad-hoc Agent
dispatches for planning, implementing, or reviewing should either pass the
session's model explicitly or omit the model so it inherits. When the
session runs Fable, subagents run Fable. Do not downgrade dispatches to
Sonnet/Haiku for economy unless the user asks for it — a skill's own
cost-tiering guidance does not override this (2026-08-05: a whole
plan executed on Sonnet/Opus subagents under a Fable session before anyone
noticed).

A step is delegable when it is self-contained enough to hand to someone who
has not read this conversation — which a written plan task already is.
Bundle the context it needs into the prompt; subagents do not inherit the
main thread's context.

Escalate back to the main thread the moment a delegated step turns out to
need a decision. A subagent guessing at design is the failure mode this split
exists to avoid, and it is worse than not delegating at all.

Do not delegate: anything still being designed, debugging with an unknown
cause, or a change whose blast radius is not yet mapped.

## Commands

```sh
pnpm test        # vitest, whole workspace — must be green before anything ships
pnpm typecheck   # tsc --noEmit across every package, in parallel
pnpm build       # builds the editor page the CLI serves from editor-dist/
pnpm fixture     # generates a synthetic test video
```

## House style

Comments explain *why*, not what, and cite the findings section that forced
the choice where one exists (`R24 §117`, `§93a`). The history is full of
comments that are the only record of a bug that cost hours — keep writing
them.

Pure logic is separated from I/O so it can be tested without a filesystem, a
TTY, or a network: `openCommand()` returns a `{bin, args}` pair and
`openInBrowser()` spawns it, and that split is why the platform matrix has a
test. Follow it.

Values that come from a user are parsed with zod, never coerced. A typo'd
`--source-fit containn` silently falling back to `cover` is the exact crop
the flag exists to prevent.

## Releases

All four packages (`ossclip`, `@ossclip/core`, `@ossclip/renderer`,
`@ossclip/scenes`) move in lockstep, in a single `0.1.X: <headline>` commit.

The 0.1.4 → 0.1.5 gap is the cautionary tale: the fix for `ossclip edit`
crashing on Windows and Linux landed one commit *after* the version bump, so
npm shipped the crash to every non-macOS user for the life of the release.
Bump last, and check `git log <last-tag>..HEAD` before publishing.
