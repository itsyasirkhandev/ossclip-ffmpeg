  // drifts on scroll, and the playhead-follow `scrollIntoView` above fires
  // the body's scroll event whenever the followed word left the pane — the
  // menu was destroyed within a frame of appearing. The remaining close
  // paths are Escape, the selection clearing, a word-count change, and the
  // gestures themselves. Everything is optional-chained: jsdom reports
  // all-zero offsets, which clamp to a fine in-pane position — tests mock
  // the offsets they assert on. `width` is a dep because a divider drag
  // reflows the wrap under the anchor word; `rangeEditing`/`timing` are deps
  // because those two surfaces REPLACE the bar at this anchor and are much
  // taller — without a re-measure they inherited the bar's placement and
  // hung off the bottom of the pane. `editing` joined them (2026-08-19
  // review): the retype input replaces its word's SPAN, so the anchor this
  // effect measures is gone while the box is open, and without the dep a
  // stale `menuPos` kept the bar floating over the input — where clicking
  // Delete blurred the box (committing the retype through `onBlur`) and
  // opened the delete confirm in the same gesture. The bar's render gate
  // hides it outright; this keeps the position from surviving the box.
  //
  // Two passes by construction (2026-08-18 round 5, replacing the EST_W
  // guess): pass one has no mounted surface to measure, so it places on a
  // zero-size box; the state change mounts it and `menuPos` — itself a dep —

 *
 * Prior art, and why this is not a repeat of it: round 3 replaced a dark box
 * + blue outline with an underline because that box "fought the band" — it
 * was the same near-black fill the band's neighbours had, so the eye could not
 * tell playhead from selection. A DISTINCT hue plus the corner difference is
 * what settles that now. NO box-shadow bridge: that trick is selection-only
 * (`selectedStyle`), where the point is one continuous band — bridging here
 * would fuse the playing word into its neighbours and light up three.
 *
 * It also RESTORES strike-through on hidden words: `textDecoration` is a
 * single property, so the old underline clobbered `hiddenStyle`'s line-through
 * for exactly as long as the playhead sat on a hidden word. A background

 * selection, and rounded corners re-stripe the band at every span edge.
 *
 * The band bridges the BARE inter-word space (§65) with a box-shadow rather
 * than by swallowing the space into the span, which is what the round-3

 * padded inline box no longer hangs, and the body scrolled sideways by
 * exactly one space width (CI run 32195920547; the word map has the
 * measurement). A box-shadow paints OUTSIDE the border box and contributes
 * nothing to `scrollWidth`, so it satisfies both. The 4px offsets are the
 * `word` style's own horizontal padding: each span's bridge reaches from its
 * padding edge to where its neighbour's begins, so consecutive selected
