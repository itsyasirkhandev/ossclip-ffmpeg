 *
 * Excluded windows — each one is a commit that could not honestly apply:
 *  - overlapping the selection itself (the selection is committed
 *    separately, under its own captured `was`);
 *  - containing an anchorless word (§137 — no source anchor, no key; the
 *    same refusal every caption gesture makes at the gesture);
 *  - containing a word covered by a LIVE range entry (minted anchors exist
 *    only while their entry does — re-keying under a new pair loses BOTH
 *    rewrites, the `openRangeEdit` covered-expansion lesson);
 *  - for a SINGLE-word selection, a candidate sharing the selection's own
 *    anchor (`backfillSrcStart` MANUFACTURES shared source instants,
 *    captions.ts:44-50 — two spans, one key, and the "occurrence" would
 *    just re-write the selection's own entry);
 *  - overlapping an ALREADY-ACCEPTED occurrence: the sweep is greedy and
 *    advances past each match, because two overlapping entries appended in
 *    one bulk commit would trip the reducer's overlap scrub — the second
 *    entry silently deleting the first inside the same gesture.
