/**
 * Isolation, done automatically rather than left to whoever runs this: copy
 * the committed fixture workdir into a fresh OS temp directory before the
 * webServer below even starts, and point the edit server at that copy — so
 * there is no env var for a caller to remember to export, and no way for a
 * previous run's `overrides.json` to leak into this one.
 *
 * This has to happen at config-load time (module top level), not in a real
 * Playwright `globalSetup` file: the `command` string below is built by
 * interpolating a JS value into a template literal right now, when this
 * module executes, and Playwright starts webServer processes as part of
 * loading its config's plugins — BEFORE it runs the user's `globalSetup`.
 * A `globalSetup` would be too late to affect the path the server is told
 * to serve (and, worse, it would still be empty at the moment the edit
 * server tries to read `render-props.json` out of it and exits early).
 *
 * The catch: Playwright loads this config module more than once per run —
 * once in the process that starts the webServer, and again in each worker
 * process that runs a spec file — and `mkdtemp`'s random suffix would give
 * each of those loads a DIFFERENT directory, leaving the spec reading
 * `overrides.json` from a path the running server never touches. The
 * directory name is made deterministic instead (scoped to the root
 * process's pid, which is the same across a main-process load and a
 * worker's load of the same invocation, and different across separate
 * `playwright test` invocations), and population is guarded by a marker
 * file so only the first of those redundant loads actually copies.
