/**
 * Review fix on folder-input-brief.md's first cut: the default --out path
 * used to derive from `input` AFTER a folder run reassigns it to
 * `<workdir>/source-concat.mp4`, so `ossclip produce ~/Downloads/MyClips`
 * with no -o wrote its output INSIDE the hidden .ossclip workdir instead of
 * beside the folder. `defaultOutPath` must always be called with the
 * ORIGINAL input the user typed (produce.ts's `originalInput`), never the
 * reassigned `input` — these tests pin what it does with a folder-shaped
 * (extension-less) path and a normal file path.
