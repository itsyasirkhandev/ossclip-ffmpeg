 * The produce wizard. Forty-four flags (plus the positional input path)

 * five flags (--out, --cleanup, --aspect, --produce, --intent) — twelve
 * behind one "anything else?" multiselect (--sfx being the twelfth, with
 * --sfx-level as its follow-up prompt rather than an entry of its own), and the remaining stay flags-only:
 * debug/internal surfaces, replay-only fields, --no-watermark (the
 * multiselect only turns the credit ON; off is already the default),
 * --no-youtube (the same shape: the pack entry only turns it ON),
 * --color-grade (2026-08-30, the --resolution shape: a channel's look is a
 * durable machine preference, set once as `colorGrade` in
 * ~/.ossclip/config.json rather than re-picked per wizard run — and an
 * honest prompt would need to enumerate ~/.ossclip/luts and preview five
 * presets, a design nobody has made; --no-color-grade then mirrors
 * --no-watermark's tier for the same off-is-default reason),
 * --captions (the mirror case: ON is already the default, so the
 * multiselect entry is the OFF switch and the positive flag exists only for
 * replay pinning), --add-jump-cuts (same mirror: auto already punches, the
 * multiselect entry is the OFF switch, and the force flag exists to beat a
 * future config-off),
 * --whisper-backend (2026-09-01, the --color-grade shape: it selects machine
 * INFRASTRUCTURE — which transcription engine this box owns, alongside
 * whisperPath and modelDir — not a per-run editorial choice, and the durable
 * spelling is `whisperUrl` in ~/.ossclip/config.json; an honest prompt would
 * also have to explain a base URL and an API key at a menu), or
 * (final-review fix wave, Finding 1) --sort. A folder's clip order only means anything once the
 * folder has been enumerated, and that enumeration happens inside
 * `produce()` — after the wizard has already returned argv — so there is
 * nothing for a prompt to offer a choice about beforehand. --sort stays
 * typed-only, same tier as --clip-window below, not a tenth multiselect
 * entry.
 *
 * --clip-window is deliberately NOT offered: --clip runs write it into
 * command.json so the editor's Render replays the same window without an LLM
 * call. A human picking it from a menu is a corrupted replay, not a
 * preference.

 * answered "no" to graphics is offering a menu item that is a guaranteed
 * error nine prompts later — so the clip extra is only ever listed once
 * graphics is already on. Exported and kept pure so this can be asserted
 * without a TTY.
 *
 * The sfx entry is gated on the same precedent (2026-08-29). Sound effects
 * are placed against the producer's beat sheet, so a `--sfx` run without
 * `--produce` reaches produce.ts's own "sound effects are placed against the
 * producer's beat sheet — add --produce" warning and renders silent (a
 * previous run's plan in the workdir is the only thing that saves it, which
 * is not something a menu can promise). A guaranteed-inert menu item is the
 * same broken offer as the clip one, softer only in that it warns instead of
 * throwing — so it is only ever listed once graphics is already on.
 *
 * `watermarkFromConfig` (review, minor a): on a config-on machine the
 * watermark entry sits UNCHECKED while the credit will render anyway —
 * unchecked is "don't emit the flag", not "off", and the multiselect has no
 * way to say the second thing. The honest cheap fix is to say so in the
 * entry's own hint rather than pre-checking it (a pre-check would emit a
 * redundant --watermark and teach a command line longer than the run needs,
