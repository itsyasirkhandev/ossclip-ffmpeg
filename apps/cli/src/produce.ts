 *    it, so a portrait and a landscape selection of the same source cannot

  // twice. `originalInput` (the folder itself) is the natural place someone

  // `staticFile()` only ever looks in ONE directory, `dirname(renderVideo)`.

  // `mezzanineWillBuild` boolean set above (shared with the real
  // `renderVideo` assignment further down, so the two can't disagree about
  // which directory wins). An image accepted from a sideDir that isn't THAT
  // directory used to pass this check and then 404 mid-render — a failure
  // that surfaced only after the whole pipeline had already spent its budget
  // getting there. The fix is to make the two agree by construction: copy
  // the file into the render's public dir the moment it's accepted from
  // anywhere else. This also retires the "latent" file-input+mezzanine case
  // the reviewer found pre-existing: an image beside a source video that
  // then gets mezzanine'd (the default) was accepted from `dirname(input)`

  // branch earlier.
