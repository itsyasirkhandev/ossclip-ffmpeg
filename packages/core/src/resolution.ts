 * How big the output actually renders (2026-08-27).

 * enforced it: the folder-concat target, the mezzanine's scale filter, and
 * the render. A 4K take therefore lost three quarters of its pixels before
 * anything looked at it — invisible on LinkedIn/Instagram/TikTok, which cap
 * at 1080p anyway, but real on YouTube, which keeps 4K and gives it a better
 * codec tier.
 *
 * This is the ONE place that decides the size, so those three stages cannot
 * disagree. It returns a SCALE FACTOR, not a stage to build from: the
 * composition must stay 1080-wide because `captionFontSizeFor` (scenes/
 * stage.ts) answers in ABSOLUTE px — 64 portrait, 44 landscape — so a
 * composition built at 2160 would draw captions a quarter of their intended
 * size. Remotion's own `scale` renders that same composition larger, fonts
 * and strokes included.
