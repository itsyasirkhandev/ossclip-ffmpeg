   * absolute window is not a seam edit — the user placed it against the audio
   * and only the user gets to say two captions may not share a moment.
   * OVERLAP IS THEREFORE LEGAL here (the renderer mounts overlapping

   * stamps under it (Phase A): the KEY names a word whose stamp moved, and the
   * value is a window the user placed against audio that did not.
   *
   * The floor and the ordering are the schema's, not a clamp: a window
   * narrower than `MIN_CAPTION_SEC` is a delete wearing a timing gesture's
   * clothes (the constant's own docstring) and an inverted one would mirror

   * (retime-preview.ts) build the SAME `TimeMap` over the render-props' own

   * VERBATIM (`resolveCutSourceRanges`, recut.ts) — the arriving `src` wins,
   * exactly as it does for a src produce itself resolved — and the priorMap
   * fallback stays for legacy src-less entries, which is what keeps every
   * overrides.json written before this reading identically.
   *
   * Three shapes, all meaningful:
   *   {startSec, endSec}      — legacy/no-mapper: marked-only, produce
   *                             resolves `src` on the next run.
   *   {startSec, endSec, src} — the editor's normal write: the record plus
   *                             the anchor, resolved at write time.
   *   The record may be CLAMPED (or absent-in-spirit) when the window sits
   *   in revived material with no old-clock image — historical, never
   *   authoritative once `src` exists, so a clamped record is honest.
   *
   * `src` present also means LIVE-APPLIED in the editor: the preview
   * subtracts those ranges and genuinely stops playing the material
   * (retime-preview.ts's module doc). The rest of the original rule stands:
   * if a cut's range is ever edited/moved (not currently exposed, but the
   * rule holds for any future gesture that would), its `src` is DELETED
   * rather than carried forward, so the next produce re-resolves it against
   * the render-props current at that point rather than an anchor drawn for a
   * range that no longer means the same thing; Restore removes the WHOLE
   * entry, `src` included — there is no "not cut" state for one array entry

 * confirming itself: two independent facts agreeing. The same word appearing

 * does NOT gate this branch (ruling on the §137 plan, task 2: folding the
 * exact hit into the candidate scan makes a confirmed record lose to an
 * unrelated coincidence, and a doc that never drifted at all would stop
 * migrating because the user happened to edit a repeated word — that breaks
 * "every existing overrides.json keeps working" for a case where we have the
 * answer).
 *
 * When the word at that position is NOT the edit's `was`, the position has
 * been PROVEN wrong (a cut removed words before it), so search outward for
 * the `was`: that recovers the field case rather than discarding work the
 * user already did. Ambiguity gates that search alone — two candidates a
 * search genuinely cannot tell apart are reported instead, because a wrong
 * anchor silently rewrites the wrong word, which is worse than an edit the
 * user has to redo.
 *
 * TWO LEGACY EDITS RESOLVING TO THE SAME WORD are that same ambiguity one
 * level up, and both go to `unresolved` — the output is a Record, so writing as
 * we went would have the second edit silently overwrite the first and report
 * nothing, which is the very bug this task was opened for. It is not a corner
 * case:
 *  - an outward search can land on the word another edit exact-hit (`the cat
 *    sat on a mat`, edits at "0" and "5", both `was: "the"`);
 *  - two words can share a `srcStart` outright — `backfillSrcStart`
 *    (`captions.ts:44-50`) maps seam preimages and cut-clamped words onto the
 *    same source instant BY DESIGN, so duplicate keys are manufactured, not
 *    float trivia.
 * Neither edit is guessed at, both are named, and the user can re-apply the
 * one they meant.
 *
 * A LEGACY EDIT COLLIDING WITH AN ALREADY-SOURCE-KEYED ONE is NOT that case,
 * and refusing both was a real bug (§137 Task 6 review, Important 3): a doc
 * holding both key spaces at once — `{"0": …, "w6000": …}` over one word — is
 * the normal shape of any project edited before and after this change, and
 * treating it as an unbreakable tie DELETED the newer, current-format edit
 * whose anchor was never in doubt. The source-keyed edit WINS: it is the one
 * the editor wrote most recently, it names its word directly rather than by a
 * position something may have shifted, and it is the format everything else
 * reads. Only the legacy claim is retired, reported as `superseded`. (There
 * can be at most one source-keyed claimant per anchor: such a claim resolves

 *
 * Retiming across lines: the run may span several lines, and their `start`/
 * `end` WINDOWS are deliberately not re-packed — Sequence windows and
 * `buildCaptionLines`' breakpoint semantics stay exactly as produced.
 * Replacement tokens are distributed across the affected lines
 * proportionally to each line's share of the run's summed word duration,
 * rounded by largest remainder (deterministic — earlier line wins a tie) so
 * every token lands somewhere and the totals match. Within a line the stamps
 * follow `retimeCaptionTokens` above; a token count equal to the run's word
 * count skips all of it and keeps the measured per-word stamps AND srcStarts
 * verbatim (measured ASR boundaries beat interpolation — `retime`'s rule).
 * A line allotted zero tokens loses its run words, and if that empties it
 * the line is omitted (the `applyCaptionWordHides` rule — no zero-word
 * Sequence).
 *
 * srcStart minting for count-changed runs: linear across `[fromSrc, toSrc]`
 * (the endpoints' own source starts), endpoints re-minted verbatim — which
 * is what lets the user select a rewritten run again and edit it (its
 * endpoints still answer to the same pair). Strictly increasing whenever the
 * span is non-degenerate; when the span is too short for 1ms-distinct
 * quantised keys (`captionKeyFor` rounds to ms), later words SHARE quantised

 * Drop hidden caption words (the `captionWordsHidden` layer). Same reporting

 * reason: a hide that silently fails looks like the editor forgot it.
 *
 * Runs on the DERIVED `CaptionLine[]`, never on `transcript.words` — scene
 * anchors are raw word INDICES into the transcript, so splicing a word out of
 * it would shift every later anchor onto the wrong word: the forbidden
 * operation this whole layer exists to avoid. The transcript stays intact;
 * only the rendered caption stream loses the word.
 *
 * Line WINDOWS are recomputed here, deliberately: `buildCaptionLines` derives
 * `start` from the first word and `end` from the last word plus a hold (its
 * hold/breakpoint clamp loop, then `enforceLineDwell`), so hiding a boundary
 * word would otherwise leave the
 * line lingering on screen over silence — up for the hidden first word's
 * duration, or held past the hidden last word's end. A hidden FIRST word moves
 * `start` to the first survivor; a hidden LAST word re-bases the packer's hold
 * delta onto whichever word is now last (clamped so the line never ends before
 * its own last word); middle hides leave the window alone. A line whose words
 * are ALL hidden is omitted entirely, so the downstream CaptionTrack emits no
 * Sequence for it.
 *
 * `was` is the LIVE (post-retype) text at hide time — hides apply AFTER
 * retypes (`applyCaptionLayers` below) — so un-retyping a word under a hide
 * stales the hide, and it is REPORTED rather than guessed at. Same
 * first-claimant rule as `applyCaptionEdits`: ms-quantised keys CAN collide
 * (`captions.ts:44-50` manufactures duplicates by design), and one hide must
 * remove one word, not every word sharing its instant.

 * Apply per-LINE caption TIMING nudges (`captionLineTiming`) — the LAST

 * can move a line's window (or remove the line entirely), and a nudge stored
 * on a line the hides emptied has no window to move (it falls out of the
 * sweep as `found: null`, like every other orphaned caption record).
 *
 * EDGES, NOT ONE SHARED SEAM. Each line owns its `[start, end]` pair, and a
 * line's END and the next line's START are two separate numbers here — even
 * though on a real transcript they are always equal, because the packer chains
 * words (`transcribe.ts`: `next.start = w.end`) and clamps each line's end to
 * the next line's start (`buildCaptionLines`), giving inter-line gaps of
 * exactly zero (measured 116/116, see `captionLineTiming`). A nudge CLOSES the
 * two onto one value only when they were already COINCIDENT: that is what
 * makes a lead on the packed stream move both sides of the boundary, one edit
 * and two windows, exactly as before.
 *
 * They are two numbers because GAPS ARE REAL: `applyCaptionWordHides` re-bases
 * a line's window onto its surviving words, `MAX_CAPTION_WORD_LEAD_SEC`
 * (`captions.ts`) clamps a word's display start, and an overrides.json
 * can be hand-edited. (Citations here name the constant or function
 * deliberately — the line numbers they used to carry went stale the first
 * time `captions.ts` grew a constant.) This code
 * used to hold ONE `seams` array whose interior entry was read off the later
 * line's start, conflating the two: with lines `[0,2] [2,4] [5,6]`, a
 * lead-only drag of the middle line (`{lead: -0.05, tail: 0}`, exactly what
 * the editor writes) rebuilt the UNTOUCHED third caption as `[4,6]` — a full
 * second early, its words stretched 2x by `scaleWordsIntoWindow`, with no drop
 * reported (review 2026-08-19).
 *
 * The edge model still protects §115 (`packages/scenes/src/frames.ts:1-21` —
 * no two lines may share a frame) BY CONSTRUCTION, which is what the old "LINE
 * WINDOWS NEVER CHANGE" rule existed for: the sweep below leaves the edges
 * ORDERED (`start_0 <= end_0 <= start_1 <= ... <= end_n-1`) with every window
 * at least `MIN_CAPTION_SEC` wide, and ordered non-overlapping windows at
 * least 50ms wide cannot round onto a shared frame.
 *
 * THE SWEEP, forward: every edge is clamped into the track's ORIGINAL outer
 * bounds, no line may open before the previous line CLOSED, and no window may
 * be narrower than `MIN_CAPTION_SEC`. A backward pass then pulls lines left if
 * a track too short to hold every line at the floor made the forward pass run
 * into the end. Ordering is enforced against the NEIGHBOUR'S OWN edge, never a
 * derived seam: a nudge that runs past it is BLOCKED there rather than pushing
 * it, so a gap gets consumed but no untouched caption ever moves. (A nudge
 * takes time FROM a neighbour only through the coincidence rule above — the
 * packed case, where the two share the boundary being dragged.) The outer
 * bounds never GROW: a caption must not appear before the first caption of the
 * track or linger past the last, where there is no output left to show it
 * over.
 *
 * BOTH SIDES OF ONE BOUNDARY: line i's `tail` and line i+1's `lead` address
 * the same coincident boundary. The LATER line's `lead` wins,
 * deterministically — the UI writes both sides of a drag consistently, so this
 * only decides hand-edited docs, and a stated winner beats an
 * order-of-iteration accident. (A stored `lead: 0` still claims its edge; an
 * entry the user cleared is DELETED from the doc, not written as zeros.)
 *
 * Lines whose window the sweep did not move are returned VERBATIM — including
 * their word stamps — so a nudge on one caption cannot perturb the rest of
 * the track. The ones that did move (the nudged line AND, on a coincident
 * boundary, its neighbour) have their words scaled into the new window by
 * `scaleWordsIntoWindow`.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NO `was` GUARD, unlike `captionWordsHidden`: timing is
 * text-orthogonal — a retype under a timing nudge changes what the caption
 * says, not when it is said, and staleness on text would drop nudges the user
 * never un-meant. `expected` in the drop reports is therefore always `""`
 * (the record stores no text to expect). Same first-claimant rule as every
 * per-word layer: ms-quantised anchors CAN collide (captions.ts:44-50), and
 * one nudge must move one line.

 * what it is overriding. A line carrying both records therefore shows its
 * window, and the nudge is inert rather than compounded — the audio-first tool
 * that writes windows replaced the nudge popover, so the pair only coexists on
 * docs edited across the change.
 *
 * SOURCE SECONDS IN, OUTPUT SECONDS OUT. The window is stored against the
 * waveform's clock (`captionLineWindows`' docstring: the one clock a re-cut
 * cannot move) and the caption track speaks output seconds, so each edge goes
 * through `map.toOutputClamped` — the same conversion `buildCaptionLines` uses
 * for the derived windows this replaces, with the same documented behaviour on
 * material that was cut: the edge lands on the nearest KEPT edge rather than
 * disappearing. A window whose material was removed ENTIRELY collapses both
 * edges onto one instant and comes back out at the floor below, sitting on the
 * seam: the user's window is kept and made visible, not silently dropped,
 * because the cut is the thing they are more likely to be about to undo.
 *
 * NO SWEEP, DELIBERATELY — see the field's docstring. Windows may overlap;
 * ordering against neighbours is not this layer's business, and every line
 * whose key carries no entry comes back VERBATIM (same reference, same word
 * stamps) so one placed caption cannot perturb the rest of the track. The
 * MIN_CAPTION_SEC floor is the ONE clamp, applied in output seconds because a
 * cut inside the window can narrow it however wide the source span was.
 *
 * Words are re-stamped into the new window by `scaleWordsIntoWindow` — the
 * karaoke highlight reads word stamps INSIDE the line's `<Sequence>`
 * (`CaptionTrack.tsx`), so a window moved without them lights the wrong words
 * or none.
 *
 * Same reporting contract as every other per-line layer: an anchor no line
 * starts on is `found: null` (a cut removed the word, or a hide emptied the
 * line), a second claimant is `duplicate-anchor`, and `expected` is always
 * `""` because timing is text-orthogonal (`applyCaptionLineTiming`'s no-`was`

 * would stale every hide sitting on a retyped word. Range edits sit between
 * the two, but the order barely earns the word: the reducer's creation-time
 * scrubbing (`useEdits`' `patchCaptionRange`) removes every per-word edit
 * and hide inside a new range's interval, so a LIVE range edit never
 * coexists with either inside its own words — the order only matters for
 * hand-edited docs, where the layers' own guards report rather than guess.
 * Timing runs LAST because it must see the surviving LINES: the hide layer
 * re-bases a line's window onto its surviving words and drops a line whose
 * words are all hidden, and a nudge on a line that no longer exists has no
 * window to move (`applyCaptionLineTiming`). Drop reports carry which layer
 * refused them, since "the retype missed", "the rewrite missed" and "the
 * delete missed" send the user to different gestures.
 *
 * WINDOWS run after the nudges, last of all — `applyCaptionLineWindows` owns
 * the why (an absolute answer overrides a relative one, never compounds with
 * it). That layer is the reason this composer takes a `map`: a window is
 * stored in SOURCE seconds and the caption track speaks output seconds, so
 * placing one needs the same cutlist the lines were built through. Required,
 * not optional — a caller without a map would silently skip the layer, which
 * is how the editor preview and the render would come to disagree about when
