/**
 * Token and cost accounting for the producer's LLM calls.
 *
 * Producing a video is many calls — a repair pass, a beat sheet, and one per
 * scene — so "what did that cost" is a real question with a non-obvious
 * answer. Every provider records one entry per call into its own `usage`
 * array; the CLI prices them at the end and prints a per-call-type breakdown
 * plus a total.
 *
 * Providers record TOKENS, not money. Pricing lives here alone, so a price
 * change is one table edit rather than four provider edits, and so a provider
 * that reports an authoritative cost of its own (the Claude CLI does) can
 * hand it over without every other provider growing a pricing dependency.
 *
 * Two honesty rules, because a wrong number is worse than no number:
 *   - Tokens a provider actually reports are marked exact; anything derived
 *     from text length is marked an estimate and says so in the output.
 *   - Prices change and vary by model. The table below is the DEFAULT
 *     assumption by model family, overridable in `~/.ossclip/config.json`;
 *     a model that matches nothing is reported with tokens and no cost
 *     rather than a guess.
