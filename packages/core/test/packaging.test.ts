 * The published tarball must carry every file the code reads at RUNTIME
 * (R22 §111).
 *
 * `@ossclip/core@0.1.0` shipped `files: ["README.md", "src"]` and nothing
 * else — but `face.ts` loads the vendored pico cascade from `../assets/
 * facefinder`. In this workspace that resolves through a symlink to the
 * whole package directory, so every local run and every test passed; from
 * npm it was an ENOENT the first time a source needed face detection. The
 * gap is invisible to anything that reads the repo instead of the tarball.
 *
 * So this test reads the SOURCE for the paths it actually loads and asserts
 * each one is inside a `files` entry. A new runtime asset that nobody adds
 * to `files` fails here rather than in a stranger's terminal.
